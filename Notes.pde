Class: A blueprint for building an object
  Dot notation: To use something in an object, you write objectName.variable or objectName.function()
  

Arrays: Collection of objects of the same type. The collection has a fixed size.
Steps:
      1. Create it (String names[])
      2. Set the size (names = new String[4])
      3. Set the elements
        names[0] = "Eli";
        names[1] = "Quynh Ly";
        names[2] = "Daniel";
        names[3] = "Joshua";

For loops: Repeats code a specific number of times. It uses a counter variable to count
ex:
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
      
      //i goes from 0 to 6
     
    }
